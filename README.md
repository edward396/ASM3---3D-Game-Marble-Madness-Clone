## Game Overview
3D Marble Madness is a physics-based puzzle platformer where players control a marble ball through challenging 3D levels. Race against time to reach the goal while navigating obstacles, moving platforms, and enemy encounters.

## How to Run the Game

1. Go to the repository
2. Open the exe file folder
3. Double-click on "Marble Madness.exe"
4. The game will launch

## Game Controls

### Movement
- **W** - Roll forward
- **A** - Roll left  
- **S** - Roll backward
- **D** - Roll right
- **SPACEBAR** - Jump

### Additional Controls
- **ESC** - Pause menu
- **Mouse** - Navigate menus

## Gameplay Instructions

### Objective
Navigate your marble ball from the starting position to the red target zone before the timer expires.

### Level Progression
- **Level 0 (Tutorial)** - Learn basic movement and jumping mechanics
- **Level 1** - Navigate gaps and basic timing challenges
- **Level 2** - Moving platforms and enemy encounters
- **Level 3** - Complex layouts combining all mechanics

### Gameplay Elements
- **Timer** - Complete each level before time runs out
- **Moving Platforms** - Time your movements to ride platforms safely
- **Enemies** - Avoid or outmaneuver enemies that try to knock you off course
- **Physics** - Realistic marble rolling physics require momentum management
- **Respawn System** - Fall off the level to respawn at your last safe position

## Tips for Success
- Build momentum for longer jumps but maintain control for precision movements
- Plan your route on moving platform sections
- Watch enemy movement patterns to find safe paths
- Use the marble's physics to your advantage - rolling downhill builds speed

## Technical Requirements
- **Engine:** Godot 4.x
- **Platform:** Windows, Mac, Linux
- **Controls:** Keyboard required

## Development Notes
Built using Godot 4's 3D physics engine with custom GridMap level design system, featuring realistic marble physics, AI enemy behavior, and progressive difficulty scaling across multiple levels.
